Security
   * Fix a timing side channel in private key RSA operations. This side channel
     could be sufficient for an attacker to recover the plaintext. A local
     attacker or a remote attacker who is close to the victim on the network
     might have precise enough timing measurements to exploit this. It requires
     the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption. For
     details, see "Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack", Hubert Kario. Reported
     by Hubert Kario, Red Hat.
